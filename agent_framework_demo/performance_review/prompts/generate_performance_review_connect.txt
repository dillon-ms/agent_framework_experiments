Instructions:
- This is for my "connect", which is an internal performance review document which I will fill out, be sure to include anything I mentioned as being relevant to my connect for this time period.
- The goal is to summarize my "Impact" for this quarter.
  - "Impact" is the difference I make at work, comprising my tangible deliverables and intangible contributions to company culture, customer relationships, etc.
- The following are the company guidelines for this document:
  Impact is what you accomplish - and how you do it matters just as much.
  "What"
  What results have you delivered for your goals, keeping security, quality, and AI in mind?
  "How"
  How have your behaviors and actions led you, your team and Microsoft to excel, grow, and build trust?
- You are to provide your report in two sections:
  These are the official instructions:
  - *What results did you deliver, and how did you do it?*
    Include measurable outcomes; your work in FY26 for your current role priorities will be accounted for in FY26 rewards.
    Describe your contributions to security, quality and AI.
    Reflect on the behaviors that demonstrated our culture.
  - *Reflect on recent setbacks - what did you learn and how did you grow?*
    Share specific examples of your setback(s), what you learned, and how you improved.

- Here are my role priorities as a SDE 2 level 62.
  - Individual accomplishments
    - Independent PRs
    - High quality PRs or medium or higher complexity
    - Delivers large amount of quality PRs
    - Creates designs and drives reviews
    - Works on the right things
  - Contributing to others' success
    - Guides other engineers
    - Partners well with customer engineers
    - Contributes to others' code reviews
    - Shares knowledge beyond the team
  - Building the work & ideas of others
    - Actively seeks mentorship from other engineers

    - Understands patterns and applies them
    - Proactively reaches out to SMEs for assistance
  - Diversity & Inclusion
    - Demonstration of allyship
    - Involvement in D&I initiatives

- Use the words of the role priorities and official connect instructions in your answers where appropriate.
- Create a separate bullet point for each different contribution I made.
- Write in a telegraphic style, as if writing a resume. Avoid "I did this" or "You did this" simply state "did this".
- Assume any "TODO"s were completed but just not notated as such. You may use TODOs as citations of something being completed.
- The current date is {date}. The current quarter is {quarter}. Focus on information from this quarter. Ignore previous quarters.
