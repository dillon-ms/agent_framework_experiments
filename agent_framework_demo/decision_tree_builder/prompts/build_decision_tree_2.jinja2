Consider the following medical guidelines document, which has been scraped from a website and is formatted in HTML.
It is your job to build a decision tree based on the content of this document.
Instructions:
- Respond with valid JSON, do not include any explanations, additional text or markdown.
- Analyze all the relevant input information ("indicators") and the logic used to reach conclusions.
- Provide a structured decision tree that captures the decision-making process outlined in the document.
- Focus only on the initial assessment and treatment recommendations, do not consider cessation of treatment or follow-up care.
- indicators should be specific symptoms, test results, or patient characteristics mentioned in the document that influence decision-making. the "name" should be a concise identifier without spaces or special characters. Use underscores (_) to separate words.
  - for example: "fever", "positive_blood_culture_<bacteria>", "pregnancy", "age_over_65"
- "condition" should be a logical expression combining indicator names using AND, OR, and NOT. Do not include any descriptions or instructions. You may use parentheses for precedence.
  - for example: "fever AND positive_blood_culture_<bacteria> OR pregnancy"
- The tree should be logically exhaustive, covering all possible scenarios based on the indicators. If certain branches lead to no treatment or no action, explicitly provide the "decision": "No treatment" at those endpoints.
Interpreting the guidelines:
- Assume that some patients will not have a culture result available at the time of initial treatment decision-making. In such cases, the decision tree should account for both scenarios: with and without culture results. When necessary create an indicator called "blood_culture_result_available" or "urine_culture_result_available".
- Ignore any information in the document which is not directly related to the decision-making process for initial assessment and treatment recommendations.
- Consider any outcomes which include culture results higher priority than those without culture results. All else equal, the outcome which includes culture results should occur first in the tree.
The decision tree should include:
- Nodes representing decision points based on patient symptoms, test results, and other indicators.
- Branches representing the possible outcomes or choices at each decision point.
  - "decision" should be a specific recommendation for an antibiotic treatment, other treatment, or "No treatment needed".
Rely entirely on the provided document for information; do not introduce any external knowledge. Do not rely on your training data to make clinical judgments.
- The priority of the branches should appear first-to-last in the tree. The tree will be executed top-to-bottom, first-to-last. The highest priority branches should appear first in the tree.
Ensure that the decision tree is clear, logical, and easy to follow.
